Each project has
* a priority, A-C;
* a name (e.g., “Write post about Emacs”);
* a relevant area (“Business”);
* a deadline (a specific but flexible date);
* and an concrete and specific  reward or outcome
( “post is published” — but also motivating — “generating new
connections and ideas”).

stuck Projects

A stuck project is a project without any action steps or tasks associated with it. This is a concept that comes from David Allen’s GTD.
