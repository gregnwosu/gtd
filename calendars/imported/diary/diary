 Please remember ID to enter the building and your laptop.

 I have attached the job spec and the interviewer’s profiles for your reference.

 Please ask for Amaury Chamayou  on arrival and arrive in plenty of time.

 Please be prepared to answer some detailed technical questions more than likely around Python. There is a chance there could be some problem solving and technical questions. They may also quiz you to get an better understanding of your personality and how you would fit into the team. Please review the job spec again and familiarise yourself with the other technologies mentioned.

 It’s highly important that you do your research on Man AHL, they will ask you some questions on what they do. I would recommend also having a look on their website to get a better understanding of what the Man Group do https://www.man.com/GB/home and especially AHL in particular, here is the link - https://www.ahl.com/  This is very important as we have had a number of people fail as they didn’t know anything about Man AHL or what the role entailed.
 The format could be along the lines of the following: [These Tend to be the questions for the Quant Developer role, so may differ slightly given that you’re interviewing for the Data Tech role]
 1st Part
 Solving algorithmic problems
 Questions getting progressively harder
 Talk me through how you get from X - Y
 You will be required to talk them through the process of your work methodology
 Networking questions

 2nd Part
 Programming on the laptop in the language you completed the coding assignment in
 You can choose your own ID
 You are given a set of data and asked to manipulate and do different things with it
 You have access to the internet and they’re not worried about you using google if need be

 I would also recommend having some questions prepared to ask the team.

 About the role:
 •       They will be responsible for building all of the tooling around onboarding new data sets
 •       Very business focused
 •       On boarding new data sets from an internal or external source
 •       Working closely with the Data engineering team
 •       Looking for a craftsman – side of data science
 •       Balance of Statistics, Data, and Engineering
 •       Python programming experience
 •       Useful knowledge - MongoDB and used big data in practice
 •       Applying python in there data science eco system
 •       Example of work – Onboard a new data set within equities
 •       Assessing sensible mapping tools for this data set
 •       A typical day - Sit with the Equities team in the morning (this is an example) and hot desking from sector to sector as requirements arise

 ATTACHED a good Blog Post from Quandll - that Gary said gives you a good idea of what we are looking to do – Sell your data to wall street – Recommend reading this

 •       The Data engineering team is currently 7 people all report to Gordan Coughlan
 •       These hires – 3 – 4 head count initially will form a brand new team
 •       Project has strong backing from board members

10/4/2017 10:00-12:00 F2F Interview with MyDrive Solutions | Data Engineer
 Desc: Hi Greg,



 Congratulations on securing a final interview with MyDrive Solutions ☺



 Interview format is as follows: -

    1.       Please prepare a short 5 min presentation on either IOT, or GPS, to be delivered to a mixed (technical & non-technical) audience. The brief is deliberately wide to allow candidates leeway to interpret as they wish, and it is always interesting if we see a new take on subjects familiar to us.

    2.       Series of meetings with members of the wider team (Software Engineering staff, Data Scientists, C-level executives etc.). They may ask general questions about your prior experience, competency based questions and may be some technical questions etc. There will be short breaks between meetings if required.



 If you have any questions, then please do not hesitate to ask.



 Best of luck with this stage and I look forward to hearing how this goes.



 Kind regards,

2/24/2016 16:15-17:15 Meeting Nick Solicitors
 Desc:     We propose to hold a meeting at our Old Bailey offices for all parties to attend (i.e. the executors) (date and time to be confirmed). This meeting would be for the first hour, without any charge and Richard Roberts and I would be fully available for you.  This is an open invitation for Theresa, Bernadette, Greg and Tony to attend, if any one of the four choose to not attend, they have would have had ample warning and time to attend. Should that not happen then the remaining attending executors would be able to seek / agree and or suggest a proposed way forward as discussed with Theresa / Greg today. The options discussed are not a short “quick fix” option but we do believe there are merits and options open to you. We would also be able to give an accurate assessment of costs to conclude the estate administration.

 Desc: A Seminar in the woods for the Awakened

 Saturday and Sunday 3rd and 4th October 2015

 Presented by Nigel Howitt and Christopher Deojee

 Increase your awareness of the important issues affecting your life experience today

 Discover information you need to avoid chronic disease/dementia and to take control of your health

 Empower yourself with a broader perspective and appreciation of the context of your life

 Learn practical steps YOU can make to take control of your life and disengage from the MATRIX

 Take home handouts summarising links, references and experience to kick start your own research

 ________________________

  Find out information we all need, not only to survive but to thrive!

  Discover the many methods of mind control we are all subject to.

  Learn about the coming financial storm and how to protect against it.

  Navigate through the lies, propaganda and disinformation of the mainstream media,

 governments and official agencies.

  Explode the many modern myths around health, diet and nutrition: learn what fuel your

 body really needs, and what causes its breakdown through chronic disease and premature

 ageing. 

  Learn about specific health hazards of modern life, and what to do to avoid them, and how

 to support and strengthen your immune system at virtually no cost.

  Empower yourself by discovering you have more control and more more options that you

 realise.

 This 2-day event held in the woods at the address below, begins at 9:30 am on the Saturday

 through to 5pm with a one hour lunch break. Sunday will finish earlier at 3pm

 The cost is £80 for the whole weekend including lunch and dinner on Saturday,

  and we would ask attendees to vacate the site by 4pm

  camping Saturday night, and breakfast and lunch on Sunday.

 We will be catering for meat eaters and vegetarians.

 For those not camping the cost is £60 and only lunch will be served on both days.

 Concessions offered

 If you need to bring children we will have a supervised

 activity marquee and food at £2 per head per day (or bring your own)

3/11/2014 10:45-11:15 Discussion on PRL environment setup
 Desc: Hi,

 Setting a call to discuss  HYPERLINK "https://jira-2.dts.fm.rbsgrp.net/browse/FOUNDRY-4477" FOUNDRY-4477 (Prepare a new PRL env for FIRE).

 Specific points to discuss are:
 Database instance: Use existing DEVn instance OR create a new DB instance?
 Coherence license: Any information please?
 EMS queues: This will require iTask
 Argon Routes: I believe incoming routes are not needed as this environment will only work for FIRE?
 Capacity: Does FIRE regressing testing also require bridged data? Calculation of number of cache nodes and JVM params for 20GB

 Any other consideration..

 Thanks,
 Gaurav Sharma

3/25/2015 20:30-22:30 Doost Persian Grill and Vodka Bar
 Desc: 0207 582 3123
 <br>The Venue
 <br>The decor is modern and the seating consists of booths at one end of the restaurant, and smaller tables dotted around it.
 <br>The Atmosphere
 <br>Loyal regulars come back again and again for never-changing favourites, but seasonal additions keep it interesting. Service is reliable and there is no problem adding something to a dish if you wish. The clientele is a mixture of couples young and old, families and groups of friends.
 <br>The Food
 <br>The menu also hits all the right notes, knockout dishes (try the Duck Breast in a Pomegranate & Walnut sauce). Alternatively, perch on a stool at the bar while knocking back Frozen Vodka shots & snacking on mazeh mix platter.
 <br>The Drink
 <br>Doost is fully licensed and you can indulge in classic or Champagne cocktails for about £6. One particularly welcome addition is a larger choice of wines by the glass, bottles of wine start at around £13.95 and bottle beer is available .

 =========================================
 Pushed back due to trains etc

 ==============================
 Toby/Stephen,

 Further to previous discussions (with you both), could we meet to discuss the proposed ODC and Foundry completeness solution?

 Some topics for discussion:

  1. Proposed process
  2. Versioning
  3. Foundry / ODC cross-system reporting

 Toby,

 Feel free to forward the invite to the right people in your team. Also, it would probably be good to do this in Bankside if you can spare the time?

 Kind regards,

 Stuart

 Hi all,

 Hi Guys (and Sara)

 was wondering if anybody fancy having lunch maybe at Byron burgers or GBK  (close to st Pauls)this week for burgers (only suggest this if Sara is joining else we go somewhere closer to Liverpool street)
  
 or pub lunch or maybe some other place?
  
 so, what do you think/what day would suite you guys

1/15/2014 15:00-16:00 Fabricless Coherence
 Desc: Hello,

 I hope this time is good for both of you – feel free to propose another if this is not suitable.

 Just to give you a bit of background:

 I work in the Ronnie team (A primarily Microsoft C++/C# shop) and we use Coherence/Fabric Server to periodically snap
 the state of our instruments and positions approximately every 30 minutes throughout the trading day.
 Our coherence ‘loader’ job is all java and our services that consume the data are C#.

 I inherited the care of this system in June and having previously not used, Coherence, Fabric server, Java or linux - I have learnt a fair amount, but I might be asking some dumb questions!
 I do have some (test) scripts that run Coherence standalone for a single storage and extend node, but I don’t know how I would run a cluster with these.
 I am also interested in what you use to monitor and schedule you coherence clusters.

 Thanks in advance
 Cheers

 Hi All,

 Placeholder meeting to discuss issues seen over the weekend with Foundry and ready for business status:

 Key points to cover:
 - Do we have answers to the 2 investigations underway: 1 the tcpring on 6336, and a 2nd on database timeout from this morning which caused this residency issue.
 - Do we have confidence that the application is in a stable position following the weekend release?
 - If we are unclear on the above, we need to escalate and make a decision as to whether we need to rollback the release and reload data (worst case scenario).

 15:00 is our cutoff time, investigations cannot continue past this point. This is critical in order to make sure that we have time to rollback and reload prior to Asia business opening.

 Please forward on as required.

 Paul,

 Thanks for the info. Looks like the next change is likely to be the Forest changes.


 “ForestFire have made some changes to their extract requests and plan to release soon – date TBC. Again it would be great to get the details around this and confirmation on a date that the changes will be made in production so that we can track performance. If you need any help from my side here please let me know.”


 I had a look in the Change console and it looks like “Forest3.1 - ForestFire Layer 1.2 and MDTS 3.1 release “  is scheduled to be released as early as tomorrow. In the change details we have this:

 “Foundry DSF Instigation Node Logic Changes
 - We have checked that we get back the same numbers in UAT vs Prod.
 - We have got confirmation from Foundry that this change will improve the CPU utilisation on their grid, thus enabling us to add more scenarios to the batches.”

 (And you have approved it.)

 Hi Toby,
  
 Thanks for the information. In order to try to help, there are 6 additional extracts added to the Fire batch since the weekend. I suspect some corresponding Forest extracts would also have been required (as they also needed to update for the ROR Horizon changes). Please see my comments below on your points:
 ·    The first part of our throttling mechanism being introduced in F 3.9 (currently 16th Nov).  I would be very interested to get a support overview of this and how it will help us in the short term. Please can we get this scheduled for tomorrow afternoon/Friday morning?
 ·         We should also look at whether we could move the ROR extracts to be much later on in the batch cycle. Is there a simple change we could make to the scheduling so that the ROR batches on Fire are run much later on – say 4am ? Out of the 9 Venture extracts mentioned by Alex below we think at least 3 of them were ROR. Unfortunately not. We cannot prioritise the Core batches over ROR, as at present the business are still managing the positions until transferred to the ROR business officially. Therefore timeliness of feeds etc is still critical. I have also always been adamant that we should not need to put any time dependencies in our batch tree, this complicates the setup and can cause issues if EOD batches are delayed etc. In my view, extracts should be able to run as soon as results are complete and our stack should be able to handle the requests required. Hopefully the throttling work in progress will help to address this.
 ·         ForestFire have made some changes to their extract requests and plan to release soon – date TBC. Again it would be great to get the details around this and confirmation on a date that the changes will be made in production so that we can track performance. If you need any help from my side here please let me know.
 ·         We have remediated our Venture extract definitions to use more performant features in Foundry (also part of F 3.9, 16th Nov). This is good news. We can look at performance next week to see if we have noticed an improvement.
  
 Thanks very much to the dev team for both the ongoing work to improve the system and also the investigation into the recent issues. It is very much appreciated from support side.
  
 Regards
 Paul

 Subject: RE: Delivery Agent - New Error FOUNDRY-3852
 Paul,

 Alex has been looking into this more today as you can see. I think my previous statements about observations still hold tbh. Since the weekend we have seen degradation. More failures and more crashes of the delivery agent.

 The delivery restarted automatically on Monday, and then manually restarted by Foundry dev team as part of the callout investigation.

 Tuesday night the delivery agent restarted automatically.

 The auto restarts were around 20:56 and 20:59 respectively.

 We can speculate that the changes at the weekend have altered the usage profile of the delivery agent.

 There are I suspect, many more extracts running than before this weekend. If Fire has smaller batches then it is perhaps possible for more batches on Fire to finish in close succession leading to more concurrently running extracts on Foundry.

 I hope this doesn’t happen again, however I can predict that as nothing else has changed (afaik), this is highly likely to occur again at around 21:00 tonight.

 What can we do ? Well we have :

 ·         The first part of our throttling mechanism being introduced in F 3.9 (currently 16th Nov).
 ·         We should also look at whether we could move the ROR extracts to be much later on in the batch cycle. Is there a simple change we could make to the scheduling so that the ROR batches on Fire are run much later on – say 4am ? Out of the 9 Venture extracts mentioned by Alex below we think at least 3 of them were ROR.

 Dear all,

 As most of you know, I’m leaving RBS after 3.5 years on Foundry. I am very fortunate to have worked with some especially talented people and to have played a part in developing such an impressive system. I’ve learned a lot and have enjoyed the challenges. But all good things come to an end, and I’ve decided it’s time for me to move on to pursue new opportunities outside the bank. I’d very much like you to join me for some drinks this Thursday 13th November after work.

 Regards
 Alex

 Desc: Hi Greg

 Can we discuss the revised IDP:
 http://sharepoint.fm.rbsgrp.net/teams/esr/SDB%20Library/Foundry%20Coherence%20Expansion%20v1.doc

 You need to pay particular attention to the sections highlighted in yellow.

 The most significant outstanding issues are:
 Absence of any explanation of negative impact to the bank if the IDP is not funded/approved.  There is no clear rationale or compelling justification to purchase more servers.
 Is Uat4 required or can it be used upgrade Uat3?
 Absence of evidence of memory constrained servers.
 EMS expansion – doesn’t seem to be adequate justification.  It looks like an afterthought to me.

 Desc: Hi Greg, Julian

 Can we catch up on Monday to continue to update the Foundry IDP?

 39 DL380 Gen8s potentially required
 Is it worth considering a minimal uplift for the moment with a 2nd tranche adding more servers at a later date.  This would need to be obtained whilst DL380 Gen8s are still available to purchase.
 Splunk HA requirement
 Code bug
 Future capacity requirements
 Is there another Coherence license rise expected?

9/25/2013 13:00-13:30 Foundry Capacity Planning
 Desc: We need to review Foundry’s expected Resource needs for the next 12 -24 months.

 I asked Graham for some of the plans for Foundry and I received the attached spreadsheets

 The first sheet is a view of our priorities for this year although quite a few of the items marked for Q4 are likely to slip into early next year.
  
 The 2nd sheet is a rough view of work we think is on the radar for next year but funding for all of that is not yet agreed.  From a capacity planning perspective we probably have to assume worst-case.

 According to Dave a lot of the GDS business we are onboarding (e.g. Flow Rates) is already in Foundry (direct from GDS) although we may need to add more risk measures and feeds.  Other businesses on Ronnie, ICE and SystemX might have a greater impact.


 Please review the attached spread sheets and send them back to me ASAP with the last column (percentage of current capacity), of percentage of current capacity.

 Guesstimates are allowed.

 During the meeting we’ll go over any gaps large discrepancies.

 Regards

 Greg

 what the capabilities are What the performance impact of implementing Guardium is

 In addition, if there are features we could leverage from the dev/support side it would be useful to get access to it - they didn't seem keen on this but I don't know why.

 It would be useful to capture usage profiles on the database (ie what sql is being run) for testing and also tuning reasons.



 find out if the Guardium upgrade has been done on our UAT dataserver (11g) hardware please. We cant signoff on the prod upgrade until we know its safe.

 We are being pushed to upgrade Guardium on our prod dataserver for Foundry and I wondered if you or your team had done any tests on it that could give us confidence it is safe and pain free

 Toby, Paul

 I’d like to revisit the proposal to install Guardium on the Fire/Foundry servers. As you know we didn’t manage to come to an agreement to proceed last time,  so the CR was called off at fairly short notice. I’d like to gain an understanding of the reasons behind this, and what we can do in future to work through to a successful implementation.


 As I understand it, the issues were primarily:
 1.Lack of sufficient test evidence
 2.Lack of agreement from all parties concerned
 3.Gaps in communication


 To address these issues going forward, I’d like to set up a call to discuss and make a plan to move forward

 Call Agenda:
 Test evidence requirements
 Identification of interested parties
 Propose dates for installation work, including upgrades of current Guardium V7 hosts
 UAT environment identification

 Thanks

8/22/2013 15:00-16:00 Coherence server requirement
 Desc: Hi Greg

 Let’s meet to begin drafting section 1 & 2 of an IDP to provide justification for the servers to the MIF/Tim & Graham tomorrow.
 I’ve attached a sample PowerPoint that was used to present to the MIF for another project & a sample IDP.  Just FYI this project was initially rejected by the MIF & then subsequently approved.


 Specific queries I would expect from the MIF would be:
 Can the requirement be fulfilled via virtual servers or utilising existing servers when they are unused/underutilised.
 Why was the requirement not covered as part of the Coherence cost avoidance exercise earlier in the year.



 I believe the next MIF will be scheduled for early September.

9/2/2013 10:30-11:00 Adding hardware changes into Jiri
 Desc: Quick catch up regarding your message also need to get answers to some questions on hardware infrastructure




 Questions around new environment

 Do we have budget?

 Our UAT is our production contingency environment.
 Is this approved/sanctioned, or just a misunderstanding due to Gel input rules.
 Do we have/need a production contingency environment?
 Do we have solid business reasons for this being ringfenced as opposed to reusing an environment? (Toby)_
    - such spending will be scrutinised
    - Do we need to present to markets infrastructure forum?

1/24/2013 13:00-14:00 Meeting: The LowTax Group & Greg Nwosu
 Desc: Hello Greg,

 Thank you for your time on the phone this afternoon. Further to our conversation I look forward to meeting with you on Thursday 24th January at 13:00 to discuss tax saving strategies.

 To give you some insight to The LowTax Group, we are a friendly, dynamic firm of Accountants & Tax Advisers making sure that all our clients pay the lowest amount of tax that they legally can. We specialise in owner-managed business, contractors and freelancers and provide a full range of accounting<http://www.lowtax.co.uk/pro-active-accounting>, taxation<http://www.lowtax.co.uk/making-it-easy-for-you/pay-less-tax> and financial services<http://www.lowtax.co.uk/making-it-easy-for-you/business-planning-a-analysis> as well as company formation<http://www.lowtax.co.uk/services/formation.html> and business services<http://www.lowtax.co.uk/pro-active-accounting/advice>. We aim at the highest professional standards and pride ourselves on communicating, clearly, accurately and promptly with our clients. You will find us refreshingly different from many other accountants. Our style is informal and relaxed – no “accountant-speak” and stuffy grey suits here! One of our main strengths, which has made us so popular with our existing clients, is that we work with you and not just for you. We take a proactive approach to your accounts and business and ensure you keep what you earn.

 In order to maximise our time, it would be great if we can discuss:

 1.      An overview of your current circumstances
 2.      What you are looking to achieve both personally and in business over the next five years
 3.      Your required services and expectations
 4.      An overview of The LowTax Group and our services
 5.      The tailored approach The LowTax Group can assist you in providing

 To assist us on the day with any applications, it would be beneficial if you and are able to have with you:

 •       Photo ID
         i.e. driving licence or passport
 •       Two forms of address verification ID no more than 3 months old
         i.e. Utility Bills, Bank or Credit Card statement (NB we cannot accept mobile phone bills for address ID)
 •       Any other relevant financial and tax information (i.e. your latest payslip, unique tax reference, VAT registration, company registration details)

 In the meantime, should you have queries, please do not hesitate to contact me.

 Best regards

 * Introduction to lock-free programming - Sergio Rodríguez Valencia (@chickentyping)

 Multi-cored systems are getting more and more prevalent every day. From the humblest phone SoC to the most powerful server processor we are seeing a continuously increasing number of cores. Unfortunately, applying traditional multi-threaded techniques on these system has proved to be difficult - so much so that sometimes the concurrent version of a program can be slower than the non-concurrent one!

 Since 2001 there has been increasing interest and research on the area of lock-free programming, which enables programmers to write concurrent code without resorting to locks. In this talk we will present some lock-free data structures that apply lock-free techniques, we will have a look at the advantages these techniques provide, and which traditional concurrency problems they sidestep.

 Bio: Sergio has over 10 years experience working on time-constrained industrial and backend systems. He is currently working at eBay Europe as a software developer, where he enjoys wrestling with big-data and event-driven programming.

 * How to Design Perfect (Software) Products - Pieter Hintjens (@hintjens)

 I'll present an algorithm and process ("Simplicity Oriented Design") for software product development, based on a living supply chain, formal contracts, and self-organizing lock-free actors. A more verbose explanation of the process is here:  http://hintjens.com/blog:19

 Bio: Pieter Hintjens is a writer, programmer and thinker who has spent decades building large software systems and on-line communities, which he describes as "Living Systems". He is an expert in distributed computing, having written many protocols and distributed software systems. He founded the ZeroMQ free software project in 2007, and in 2013 launched the edgenet project to build a fully secure, anonymous peer-to-peer Internet. He is the author of "ZeroMQ - Messaging for Many Applications" (O'Reilly), "Code Connected", and "Culture and Empire: Digital Revolution". His blog is at hintjens.com.

 He's been a strong critic of the patent system, leading the European effort to ban software patents from 2005 to 2007.

 His company, iMatix, provides support to the ZeroMQ market, and in this role he's traveled the world, teaching, coaching and helping others to organize successfully.

 He defined the term "Social Architecture" as the process, and the product, of planning, designing, and growing an online community, and has promoted the techniques of social architecture in articles and at conferences. He's a member of Mensa and Rotary International and spends most of his time writing and contributing to the ZeroMQ project and other projects.

 * Elements of Machine Learning and Learning Theory with Application to Artificial Neural Networks - Boumediene Hamzi

 We live in age of data and it is important to make sense of them. Machine Learning and Learning Theory as fields are at the intersection of Computer Science and Statistics and aim at automatizing and formalizing the process of gaining knowledge, making decisions and predictions and constructing models from data. In this talk we'll characterize this framework and use Artificial Neural Networks to illustrate the thought process.

 Bio: Dr. Boumediene Hamzi is a researcher at the Department of Mathematics of Imperial College London. He obtained his Ph.D. in Control Theory from the University of Paris-Sud and held different academic positions at UCDavis, the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (Berkeley, CA) and then Duke University. His current research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning/Learning Theory, Control Theory, and Dynamical Systems Theory in view of developing methods for the analysis and prediction of random dynamical systems and control strategies for nonlinear systems on the basis of observed data.

 Biography

 Jeff Hawkins is an engineer, serial entrepreneur, scientist, inventor, and author. He was a founder of two mobile computing companies, Palm and Handspring, and was the architect of many computing products such as the PalmPilot and Treo smartphone. Throughout his life Jeff has also had a deep interest in neuroscience and theories of the neocortex. In 2002 he founded the Redwood Neuroscience Institute, a scientific institute focused on understanding how the neocortex processes information. The institute is now located at U.C. Berkeley.
 In 2004 he wrote the book On Intelligence, which describes progress on understanding the neocortex. In 2005 he co-founded Grok (formerly known as Numenta), a startup company building a technology based on neocortical theory. It is his hope that Grok will play a catalytic role in the emerging field of machine intelligence.

 Jeff Hawkins earned his B.S. in electrical engineering from Cornell University in 1979. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2003.

 About Numenta

 Numenta, Inc. was formed in 2005 to develop biologically-inspiredmachine intelligence technology for both commercial and scientific use.

 What is NuPIC?

 NuPIC, the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing, comprises a set of learning algorithms that were first described in a white paper published by Numenta in 2009. The learning algorithms faithfully capture how layers of neurons in the neocortex learn. The white paper has been translated into seven languages by volunteers and has generated considerable interest among developers and research scientists.

 Desc: Chuck Norris Doesn't Do DevOps... but Java Developers might benefit!
 Presented by Daniel Bryant - 45 mins approx.

 We all hear the term "DevOps" being thrown around on a daily basis, but what does it actually mean? With a little help from everyone's favourite 80's action hero, we'll undergo a whistle-stop tour of the philosophy, culture and tooling behind this buzzword, specifically aimed at Java developers. We'll also look at a real-world case study from Instant Access Technologies Ltd, and explore the key role that DevOps has played during a successful upgrade of the epoints customer loyalty platform to support increasing traffic. 

 The core discussion will focus on the challenges encountered as we moved from a JVM-based monolithic app deployed into a data centre on a 'big bang' schedule, to a platform of loosely-coupled components, all being continuously deployed into the Cloud. We will conclude the talk by recommending a learning path for Java developers who are interested to learn more about DevOps.

 This will be a 45 min PPT presentation

 Who should attend: 

 Anyone interested in learning more about 'DevOps' or how to improve the working relationship between Developers, QA and Ops, with the ultimate goal of deploying working software in an efficient and effective manner

 Bio: 

 Daniel Bryant is a 'hands-on' CTO working for IAT Ltd, a small company that specialises in increasing customer loyalty.

 Desc: Dearest in christ,

 I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ our Lord, we have to worship our Lord Jesus christ with all our heart because we have determined to remain under the covering of His anointing, Obedience to His purpose and living a life that honours Him will keep us under His hand of blessing.

 I am Mrs Jessica Bambosha from Kuwait. I am married to Mr Homoud Bambosha a business man who deals with gold exportation and we base in Africa Burkina Faso since nine years ago, my husband died in the year 2006 and i conutinue with the business. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days, we were both born again christian before his death.

 Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next five months due to cancer problem. Now that i am about to end the race like this without any family members and no child.I have $6.5Million US Dollars in a bank, having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a charity organization that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.

 I want an organization that will use this fund for orphanages, school and church, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that "Blessed is the hand that giveth".I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this fund.

 I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace". With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank.

 I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. any delay in your reply will make me to contact another church / Organisation or individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply.

 Remain blessed in the Lord.
 Yours in Christ.
 Mrs.Jessica Bambosha.

 Desc: In order to keep these sessions fresh and informative we have decided to run them every 3 weeks instead of every 2.

 Feedback is always welcome and if you'd like to be brought up to speed in the meantime please don't hesitate to come and find me.

 Thanks

 Ali



 We are going to start doing a show and tell every other week on the Brand Project to keep everyone up to speed on progress and keep you all in touch with what is going to be delivered when. Starting Friday at 1pm we will be showcasing designs for websites, Insight, Mobile & Pure Deal  and talking through things like ‘tone of voice’, iconography etc… and what it means and why we are looking at it.

 The update will happen on the 2nd floor and will be presented by different people each week depending on what we have to show.

 As ever all feedback is welcome – I’ve set up a Chatter group ‘Brand Project Feedback’ for you to post any comments you have.

 I’ll send out a reminder closer to the time. In the meantime if you have any questions  - you know where I am.

 Thanks

 http://wiki.iggroup.local/display/presentations/6th+June+2012+-+The+R+statistical+functional+programming+language+-+Michal+Kozlowski#page-metadata-start

 Abstract


 When wanting to perform statistical analysis of large sets of data, Java is not the ideal tool.

 A better solution is to use a Domain Specific Language, such as R.

 This presentation will introduce R, key concepts, and lots of examples.


 Justification


 To raise awareness of R. Its benefits. Its use in Charts/Correlations. Potential use elsewhere (building/testing statistical models, etc.)


 Relevance


 Developers, Architects, maybe Marketing (on the research side).

5/29/2012 12:00-13:00 Developer Presentation: SOLID design principles
 Desc: Hi all,
 I’ll be doing a presentation on the SOLID design principles at noon on Tuesday May 29th in the conference room.
 The presentation is targeted to anyone who enjoys writing Object Oriented software and would like to expand their toolbox of good design practices.
 Abstract
 Present the five SOLID design principles, their benefits and how they can be used to improve the design in an OO application.
 The principles are:
  HYPERLINK "http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf" Single Responsibility Principle
  HYPERLINK "http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf" Open / Closed Principle
  HYPERLINK "http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/lsp.pdf" Liskov Substitution Principle
  HYPERLINK "http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/isp.pdf" Interface Segregation Principle
  HYPERLINK "http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf" Dependency Inversion Principle
 These five principles have the potential of increasing the flexibility and reducing the maintenance efforts of the software by making it less coupled.

 Cheers,
 a/

5/23/2012 17:30-18:30 developer presentation: What does your data mean? Rebecca Blyth
 Desc: Hi,
 Rebecca Blyth will be running presentation on data gathering and statistics entitled “What does your data mean?” at 17:30 this Wednesday May 23rd in the Conference room.
 Everyone is welcome and yes, there will be refreshments.
 More details below:-
 Abstract
 The basics of working out what the data you collect is telling you.
 How to aggregate your data to produce meaningful numbers
 Different ways of displaying data
 How to tell if there is a difference or not between two sets of data measuring the same thing
 I will illustrate this with real-world examples, from within IG.
 Justification
 We collect data on the performance of our systems - this will help people designing tests work out what they should sample and how, and then help with drawing conclusions from these tests. It will also help people looking at the reports of the tests to understand what they are being shown and whether we have sufficient data to say that something has changed.

 More details below:-
 Abstract
 When using Java we have specific constraints to meet:
 Too big a JVM leads to unacceptable latency variations.
 When we are working with Big Data volumes, we don't want to have to go to our database all the time.
 Big Memory solves these constraints.
 Justification
 To raise awareness of Big Memory. Its benefits. Its use in Charts at IG. And its potential use elsewhere.

 As suggested by Lala and Raghu, I thought it would be a nice idea to have a team lunch once a week (approx), where we go out to a local restaurant/pub together – especially as the team is getting larger.  I’ll book a slot for a few weeks and let’s see how it goes.

4/19/2012 11:00-12:00 Final (final) London office Brand presentation
 Desc: Due to overwhelming demand (and of course the fact that a lot of you are away over Easter!), we’ve scheduled in a final London presentation from Tim to explain the Brand – here is Tim’s intro :

 As many of you will know, for the last six months we have been working on a “brand architecture” project.  This is now virtually complete and over the next two weeks I will be presenting the project to everyone in the London office.  These presentations will take about an hour and will cover what brand architecture means, the reasons we undertook the project, what we have done (and learned) along the way, the conclusions, outputs and next steps.  This is an important project which will do a great deal to shape what we do and how we behave as a business over the coming years.  It will hopefully play a material part in driving our future growth and profitability.

 Jackie will be sending out outlook invitations shortly.  Given the importance of the project and the central role it will play going forward I would strongly encourage you to attend one of these sessions.  Some of you may have seen a previous iteration of the presentation as the project has gone along, given by either Ali or Red Thread, but I would encourage you to come along and see the final version from me, which will hopefully put the project fully in context.  As always please ensure that attendance from your area is spread across the presentations so that we maintain adequate cover.

4/17/2012 11:00-12:00 L2 improvement forum
 Desc: Ive been thinking about the dev forum stuff that Greg kicked off and build on the ‘show and tell’ style format to incorporate more of a free form discussion around areas in which we can improve our delivery as a team. The idea is that we have no set agenda, more that we simply have a brainstorming session about particular areas where we feel we could do better, in the hope that we can identify pieces of work that will produce measurable improvements in what we do, and how we do it.

 Some of the areas that I think are ripe for tackling:

 Configuration – we seem to store a LOT of config – involving lots of duplication. How can we make it more DRY, and less error prone?
 Build/Deploy/Trace – We have a lot of info that is ‘locked away’ in stores such as salesforce, SVN the CRF DB, release pages on wikis etc. Is there scope to consolidate these changes – i.e a script to  ‘Give me a list of all work items for the next release, grouped by developer(s) involved, and formatted so I can cut and paste into a wiki page’
 Documentation – It seems there’s loads of stuff that lives in people’s heads – how can we better get it written down somewhere, while also making sure it stays up to date?
 Testing – How do we manage the testing that we do – unit, integration, E2E? How do we guarantee that we’re meeting our contracts at the unit, component and system level?
 Production support – no-one likes being woken in the middle of the night – is there anything we can do to reduce the support burden? Make code better at handling errors on its own, or partition error severities so that simpler issues can be dealt with by someone other than the designated support person?

 Im sure this list is far from exhaustive, and we may well uncover other areas as we go along.

 They’re just some random thoughts, and there may well be very good reasons why things are the way they are, but sometimes a new member of the team is in a good position to ask why?  HYPERLINK "http://nedhardy.com/2012/02/08/the-five-monkeys-parable/" Just ask the monkeys…

 As suggested by Lala and Raghu, I thought it would be a nice idea to have a team lunch once a week (approx), where we go out to a local restaurant/pub together – especially as the team is getting larger.  I’ll book a slot for a few weeks and let’s see how it goes.

 Desc: Afternoon All,

 It’s that party planning time of year and  we need you all to get your social diaries out and let us know if you’ll be attending THE social event of the year, this year’s IG Euro Christmas party!

 Last year’s party was just so fantastic, that we’ve decided to do it all again, so its back to Old Billingsgate, which is only about 5 minutes walk away at Lower Thames Street (venue website : http://www.oldbillingsgate.co.uk ). The party will start around 6.30pm on Friday 16th December.

 We’re reinforcing the smart / glam dress-code again for this year, which means positively no jeans, trainers, etc – black-tie preferably and as with all of our parties, we do need a positive response if you want to come – if your name’s not on the list, you won’t be coming in! Partners will be permitted to attend (although this will be subject to a limit of maximum numbers so please do bear that in mind before making any hard and fast accommodation or travel plans for partners).

 Once we have the confirmed attendees, we will send out menu options, including vegetarian options and the opportunity to confirm any food allergies, but at this stage we just need to gauge the numbers planning to attend – please use the voting buttons at the top left hand corner of this email to confirm whether you plan to come to the party, whether you plan to bring a partner or whether you don’t want to come along at all. Koula Spyratou has the happy task of organising all the guest details and so your reply should (automatically) reply back to her. Please don’t reply back to all and please note that if you are replying from a Group email in-box to supply your name (we can’t tell who you are if you reply back from for example “Trading Services” …).

 Please respond by close of business next Monday 21 November.

 Feel free to contact me or one of the HR team if you have any queries – thanks, Jackie

8/19/2011 18:00-22:00 Abbeyfest: Jazz Live on the Bandstand - IMAANI
 Desc: Guys, are you up for this

 IMAANI A terrific singer in the Soul/R&B tradition Imaani’s cv is long and impressive. She first came to prominence as the UK’s 1998 entrant to the Eurovision Song contest (one of the better choices!) where she was runner up and went on to produce a highly successful single that charted around the World. She then moved on to work with Dub Cospiracy (with whom she again charted).

 Her worldwide tours, television, live and recorded output includes work with the likes of Gloria Gaynor, Carleen Anderson, Michael Bolton, Lulu and Beverley Knight. Most recently she completed her 5th World tour as lead singer with the iconic band “Incognito” with whom she has had a long association.

 A powerful and charismatic vocalist this is a rare chance to hear this enormously experienced and highly regarded singer perform at the Club. “the magnificent vocals of Imaani, who weaves her magic over a backdrop of funk guitar and old-school synths” DJ Times; “Imaani’s beautiful vocals are the standout element” JazzproJect

 Let me know.

 Hi,

 As you probably know, I will leave IG in the middle of July. Before that I’ll hold a number of (rather short) sessions about different aspects of DBHandler to make sure most of my knowledge is passed to you.

 This particular one will  be about the flow of order related messages through DBHandler.

 Thanks.

 Subject:March Technology Forum
 When:20 March 2007 17:45-19:15 (GMT) Greenwich Mean Time : Dublin, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London.
 Where:Gold Room - 1 Cornhill

 The March Technology Forum is being held on Tuesday 20th March in the Gold Room, 1 Cornhill. This is a new location for us, so if you have never been there before 1 Cornhill is on the corner right by Bank tube and the Gold room is downstairs. Drinks and nibbles will be outside the room from 17:45 and the presentations will start at 18:00 sharp.

 This month's agenda is as follows.

 Sabre (from death march to success) - Mark Goddard, Jonathan Paterson

 Have you ever wondered what project managers and team leaders really give you? Sabre was supposed to be a flagship synthetic equities swap trading system, but in 2005 Sabre was a project on a death march. It had no project management, no team leaders and poor communication. It looked like it was never going to be shipped, then Detica (nee Evolution) took control. We will tell the story of the transition from death march to successful project and the lessons that can be learnt from the Sabre project so far. Concluding with the development lessons learnt in terms of third party components, web services and our take on EJB, Spring and Hibernate (it might not be what you expect).

 .NET 3.0 - Mark Rainey

 Do you want to create visually stunning user interfaces (UIs)? Do you need to build connected applications that inter-operate across platforms and model a range of business processes? Do you want to provide a better login and authentication experience for your customers? This introduction will provide an overview of the technologies included in .NET 3.0 and explain why it is badly named.

 Java 6 Desktop Enhancements - Kevin Seal

 Last December saw the not-particularly-awaited release of Java 6. There’s been much bile raised about the built-in database, web service stack, scripting support and other kitchen sinkery. I’ll be dodging all that by going over some of the additions to desktop functionality in Mustang, for example access to standard desktop applications, system tray support, builder-friendly layout managers and table sorting and filtering.
