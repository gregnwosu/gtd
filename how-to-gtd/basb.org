*** open loops

*** progressive summarization
You add the layers *opportunistically*
The general idea of progressive summarization is that you want to create those notes so that, when you see them in the future, itâ€™s easy to quickly comprehend the purpose. You do that by moving through the following process:

    Layer 1: When you encounter something interesting, capture it
    Layer 2: Bold the most interesting parts
    Layer 3: Highlight the most interesting bolded sections
    Layer 4: Summarize the bolded portions and the note in your own words
    Layer 5: Turn your notes into something new: a tweet, a blog post,
    even a book
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC
** process each thing by clarify outcome and next action
*** process top item first
   no priority
   start at beginning
*** process one at a time
focus on just one thing
*** never put anything back into inbox
*** questions
   - is it actionable
**** non actionable
    - trash
    - someday/maybe
    - reference
*** what is the NEXT action
keep project plans and to do list as separate as possible
**** options on NEXT action
***** do it
less than 2 minutes
drop what your doing
if you have 350 emails you can drop the threshold to 10 seconds
***** delegate it
if someone can do it 80% as well as you DELEGATE it
***** defer it
put it into your todo list
** organsise reminders with a system you trust
everything should be in one of the seven buckets
project list is a task generator
things for iphone/mac
a project should be a *folder*!!
*** projects vs areas of responsibility
all projects should be in a folder
every task falls under an area of responsibility
not every task falls under a project
every project is inside an area of responsibility
- gtd
  - areas of responsibility (these are tags)
    - tasks/actions this (habits this is a tag)
  - projects can be tagged with multiple areas of responsibility and
    must have at least one area of responsibility
    - tasks/actions
*** tags/ labels
**** waiting for
 consider adding deadlines
 for when you are waiting for something out of your control
**** calendar/ scheduled items
 calendar hard landscape , which things can flow around
 suggested app busy-cal
 don't schedule everything
 things that need to happen at a scheduled time
**** next actions
 should be filtered down
 clear next actions for projects
 clear simple steps to do next
 only the NEXT action should go on the TODAY / AGENDA lists
**** reference material
information that we need to keep
**** someday/maybe
place where you put dreams
e.g. wines i would like to try
resturants i would like to visit
** review reminders
review your containers as often as you need to to feel comfortable
about commitments
the masterkey to GTD dont skip the weekly review
prevents your mind from taking the job of remembering
gives an elevated perspective
dont do it at work
*** when on vacation
clearing the tasks
making sure everything is taken care of
get that feeling once a week
*** how
- handle missed items/ open loops
- review budgets
- update containers
- review system
- get clean , clear , current and complete
- look at past 4 weeks
- look at future 4 weeks
*** daily checklist
- look at calendar
  - this is a hard landscape
- look at desktop
- look at computer desktop
- look at email inbox
  - these are sometimes turned into tasks
- look at things/iphone inbox
*** monthly review
- look at projects list
  - finished project/ new projects
- areas of responsibility
- goals
- look at someday maybe
*** time tracking
org-clock in clockout
see how much time you spend on gtd
see the gain , as you are more productive you can spend more time on gtd.
** do them
*** how do you choose what to do
- Context
  - what can you do?
- Time constraints
  - is it urgent
  - is there enough time to finish?
- Energy level
  - brain fried
- Priority
  - lowest importance
** skills
*** be lazy/ be efficient
be aware of what is taking lots of time and find an easier way
*** more important to be self aware
- where are you aversions
- where are your pains
- make it work for you
*** dont run with the crowd
find your own way
question conventional wisdom
*** apps
**** develop a set of criteria for apps
 - is the app very simple
 - 10 times ROI
   - if it takes 1 minute to use it needs to return more
   - needs to be free or 1 time purchase
   - should look good and be welld designed
   - multi platform
*** next steps
**** setup tools
task managmenet
calendar
reference
listmaking app
**** get streams of gtd update
gtd group david allen
unclutter
43 folders
lifehacker
twitter gtd groups
**** set aside a block of time
write down all of your open loops
