*******  Buckets
  we have various buckets called
  Where the trips go is actually on a per contract (a single customer can have multiple contracts, such as cosmos production, cosmos mydrive-acceptance, cosmos user-acceptance etc). But generally they go into the same bucket. We could do an audit to find out exactly what everything is set to now if you needed it
********  mydrive-tripdata-x

  (and just mydrive-tripdata)

    These have raw trips in, as well as a bunch of intermediate data that was processed at part of the pipeline…

********* format
     The format in there is
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     bucket/deployment_name/by_sub_id/<subscription_id>/<trip_files>
  #+END_EXAMPLE

********  intermediate data
  the intermediate data is
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     bucket/deployment_name/full_speed_events/YYYY/MM/DD/<trip_files>
     bucket/deployment_name/time_banded_events/YYYY/MM/DD/<trip_files>
     bucket/deployment_name/xml_profiles/YYYY/MM/DD/<trip_files>
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  e.g.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ```2016-09-30 13:23:12 mydrive-tripdata
     2015-04-07 13:25:12 mydrive-tripdata-axauk
     2016-09-30 12:18:43 mydrive-tripdata-dev
     2016-09-30 12:19:02 mydrive-tripdata-generali-germany
     2017-11-07 11:02:44 mydrive-tripdata-generali-italy
     2013-11-25 17:07:40 mydrive-tripdata-isaac

     2016-09-30 12:18:57 mydrive-tripdata-shared
     ```
  #+END_EXAMPLE

     some of those are not used, and some are confused

******** deployment
     deployment means a deployment of infrastructure hardware.

     We have

********* generali-germany
********* generali-italy
********* generali-india
********* staging
********* mydrive (which is called demo inside those tripdata directories, so s3://mydrive-tripdata/demo/ is where it’s files go), this was an old shared deployment, so companies which didn’t need to be on private infrastructure all went on here, along with the production mydrive app in the app strore
******** mydrive app in the app store
********** dev
********** labs
********** axaie
********** shared (this is the modern shared deployment) (edited)
******** Infrastruture
       Infrastructure config goes in s3://mydrive-infrastructure/
       This has loads of folders in I don’t knwo what they are for, but it also has
********* mydrive-infrastructure/deployments (deployment specific infrastructure config)
********* terraform (where terraform stores it’s state files)
